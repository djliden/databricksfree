# Databricks Free Edition Demos

This repository contains a selection of demos covering a range of Databricks use cases, all compatible with the Databricks Free Edition.

## Chef Casper's Ghost Kitchen

All demos in this repository use Casper's Ghost Kitchen as a fictional business example.

A ghost kitchen is a commercial cooking facility designed exclusively for delivery orders: no dining room, just kitchen space optimized for fulfilling online orders. Multiple restaurant brands often operate from a single ghost kitchen facility.

This business model generates rich operational event data throughout the order lifecycle, from initial order placement, through kitchen preparation, driver assignment and pickup, real-time delivery tracking with GPS coordinates, to final delivery confirmation. Each order creates multiple timestamped events with detailed JSON payloads capturing everything from kitchen progress to driver location pings.

Casper's Ghost Kitchen processes hundreds of orders daily across multiple virtual restaurant brands, creating realistic datasets perfect for demonstrating data engineering, analytics, and AI applications with Databricks.

### Run the demos

Each notebook in the repository's root directory is a standalone demo. You can run them in any order, and each one is designed to be self-contained. The demos are:

- [Agents](agents.ipynb): This demo shows how to register Unity Catalog functions and allow AI models to call them via the Databricks Mosaic AI Playground.
- [Lakeflow](lakeflow.ipynb): This demo shows how to use Declarative Pipelines to create a Medallion architecture that reads events from JSON, normalizes the data, and publishes gold summary tables.
- [AI/BI Genie](ai_bi_genie.ipynb): This demo shows how to use Databricks AI/BI Genie to explore your data with natural language, configure custom instructions, and generate SQL queries and visualizations.
